1) Create a Worker class and the define how to process the batch;
  ```ruby                                                                                                      
  class MyWorker
    include Upperkut::Worker
                                                                                                        
    # This is optional
                                                                                                        
    setup_upperkut do |s|
      # Define which redis instance you want to use
      s.redis = Redis.new(url: ENV['ANOTHER_REDIS_INSTANCE_URL'])
                                                                                                        
      # Define the amount of items must be accumulated
      s.batch_size = 2_000 # The default value is 1_000
                                                                                                        
      # How frequent the Processor should hit redis looking for elegible
      # batch. The default value is 5. You can also set the env
      # UPPERKUT_POLLING_INTERVAL.
      s.polling_interval = 4
                                                                                                        
      # How long the Processor should wait to process batch even though
      # the amount of items did not reached the batch_size.
      s.max_wait = 300
    end
                                                                                                        
    def perform(batch_items)
      SidekiqJobA.perform_async(batch_items)
      SidekiqJobB.perform_async(batch_items)
                                                                                                        
      process_metrics(batch_items)
    end
  end
  ```

  ```ruby                                                                                                
  Myworker.push([{'id' => SecureRandom.uuid}, 'name' => 'Robert C Hall',  'action' => 'EMAIL_OPENNED'])
  ```
                                                                                                        
3) Start Upperkut;
